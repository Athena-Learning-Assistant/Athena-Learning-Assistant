# Fine-tuning LLaMA 2 Model for Chat Applications

## Overview
This repository contains instructions and code for fine-tuning the LLaMA 2 model specifically for chat applications using various optimization techniques and libraries. The goal is to create a highly efficient and effective chatbot model capable of handling Indonesian language tasks.

## Installation

### Install Required Packages
Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install -q accelerate==0.21.0 peft==0.4.0 bitsandbytes==0.40.2 transformers==4.31.0 trl==0.4.7
```

### Import All Required Libraries
Import the required libraries and modules for configuring and training the model:

```python
import os
import torch
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import (
    AutoModelForCausalLM,
    AutoTokenizer,
    BitsAndBytesConfig,
    HfArgumentParser,
    TrainingArguments,
    pipeline,
    logging,
)
from peft import LoraConfig, PeftModel
from trl import SFTTrainer
```

## Dataset Preparation
The datasets used for training the model include text generation, text summarization, and question answering datasets sourced from various repositories.

## Fine-tuning Process

### Model Loading and Configuration
Define the model and dataset, set QLoRA parameters, configure Bitsandbytes for 4-bit quantization, and set TrainingArguments for the training process.

### Training Initialization
Initialize the SFTTrainer with the configured model, dataset, and training parameters to start the fine-tuning process.

### Saving the Trained Model
Save the fine-tuned model after training completes.

## Pushing Model to Hugging Face Hub
Push the trained model and tokenizer to the Hugging Face Hub for sharing and deployment.

## Usage
Once trained and pushed to the Hub, the model can be used for inference by loading it like any other LLaMA 2 model from the Hub.

### Example Inference
Run the text generation pipeline using the trained model:

```python
prompt = "Buatkan saya pertanyaan tentang animalia"
pipe = pipeline(task="text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, max_length=200)
result = pipe(f"<s>[INST] {prompt} [/INST]")
print(result[0]['generated_text'])
```

## Additional Notes
- Ensure GPU compatibility and optimize memory usage during training.
- Use Git LFS for managing large model files efficiently.
